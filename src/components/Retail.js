            Kindhood’s innovative girls’ and boys’ poncho towels are more than just a comfy, absorbent, and fast-drying towel. These children’s cover-ups are a solution to the frequent complaints of a child who’s “freezing” after swimming or bathing. Our towels also put an end to the fuss and frustration of a child who’s wrapped up tight in a bath towel, unable to move or play. Our girls’ and boys’ poncho towels can easily be slipped over your little one’s head, so they can continue to run, play, and stay warm. As talk about our free-fitting and fashionable children’s cover-ups increases, so do the opportunities for our poncho and hooded towels to be sold in stores. Find out which of your favorite stores we’re partnered with here.
